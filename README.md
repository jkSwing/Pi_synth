This project is a secondary project in Shantou University. It's a simple keyboard based on Raspberry Pi using wiringPi and libfluidsynth. 

**Note:** The main soundfont file is not included since it's over 200 MB so github cannot contain it. It's a TOUHOU sound library. Contact me if anyone wants to obtain it.
